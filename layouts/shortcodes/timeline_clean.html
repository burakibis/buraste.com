            >This is my first real job! But my salary too low. I send mail
            (daily profit reports etc.) to company owners on my manager behalf,
            he said no one should know this üôÉ I am really idiot. But I learned
            Visual Basic and I become master of Excel. Excel started to take
            care of many manual things that our department had to do. So my CEO,
            CFO, managers that I send regularly mail. So my CEO, CFO, managers
            that I send regular mail loved me. Because they saw
            "manager-friendly" spreadsheets, auto-generated mails (not
            complicated Excel files attached), clear and straightforward
            call-to-action reports. When I got new job offer, my CFO said "If
            you leave, you can't come back! This is last chance" and offered me
            double my salary. But this is not poker and we don't play a game
            idiot. He should work hard or need to find someone to email him on
            his behalf üòÇ

            warehouse). There are boxes everywhere. But they offered me huge
            salary and authority to direct all departments. It's really big
            chance for self-development and learning all of things such a sales,
            marketing, accounting and of course business analytics. I am Excel
            hero. I shuffled the garbage, prepared critical reports, identified
            the unprofitable parts. Everyone hated me, the boss loved me. I
            worked hard to learn and done everything. But after a while I
            overdose because everyone want more than now.

            them a bonus that shows they need to work harder next month than
            past month. But everything is on Excel. Ok I am Excel Hero but
            that's a little too much. Because Excel is not a
            object-relationship-database. You neet to build relationships. You
            can't create tests, you can't work on huge datasets. If you
            calculate huge datasets with complex rules, you must to use
            applications where you can set rules and manage rules. They don't
            have and all of responsibility is on your shoulders. This is too
            much stress. You can't create/develop things, just calculate. You
            are calculator If you just calculate and prepare reports so you may
            run out of charge, may make a mistake. But I met Wordpress and PHP
            at there. After that I learned Python & Django for developing own
            tools. I developed a career website that accept job applications for
            HR department. So I learned that I could improve something. I am not
            calculator, I can develop calculator ü§ñ

            seems strange at first, but I was just the middleman of this
            business and all I wanted was to learn the hierarchy and logic of
            e-commerce, earn commission-based money and mediate this pleasure.
            People told me so much that the project would not make any money

            comfortable and we were able to take time for ourselves. But
            problem: We had never had free time before cause of works and we
            needed money to spend our free time. So we needed to earn money
            another way while we were working. We wanted to sell something we
            used. We just wanted to try make natural incense and handmade
            natural candles. We took a very small amount of material and made it
            in one day. Yes, we could! So why don't we sell them? We found a
            brand name: Hello Minaste, purchase domain and from night to morning
            I created a website with Wordpress and WooCommerce.
            <br />
            <br />
            Right now we sell natural stones and jewelrys, natural incense
            include Palo Santo, natural candles, candle making kits,
            aromateraphy goods such as essential oils and oil burners to 22
            country include USA. We have been the leader in spiritual products
