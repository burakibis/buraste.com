Hello It's me, Burak üëã

For small part of my life, I lived what like they want. The day I realised this was not my life, I changed. Ever since I changed they (still) said "It's not true". They told me that everything I owned, worked, earned, learned would go to waste, especially my CV üòÇ. It's really..

My manager at my old company (that is biggest company in Turkey) said If I leave the job, I fail to keep up on business life and companies never hire me. After 1 years, I started my first company. Right now, I have own "companies" those have employees.

Fuck all of CVs, biggest companies, idiot managers and their hierarchy! ‚öîÔ∏è
Make your road.

This is my personal blog where I talk about coding, entrepreneurship, life hacks, problems, answers, ideas. I am silent performer not an entrepreneur. I spent a long time without do anything, especially at university. Because I did not know about what I want, what I can. I tried a lot of things. Today I know that I want and I am walking on my way.

I have a condition called [_Dissociative Amnesia_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychogenic_amnesia).
That's why I write so that I don't forget.
I gave up so much to learn, I don't have time for trying again üß†

I love analog photography üë∞‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è but for now I usually prefer digital photography based of product shoots. I prefer digital because analog photography is too much expensive, today. And in Turkey, I can't find fresh films and quality scan.

You can find few analog photos by taken me on [my Flickr üì∑](https://www.flickr.com/photos/burakibis/).
